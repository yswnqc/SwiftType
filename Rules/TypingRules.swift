/// Defines the language-specific typing rules used by `InputController`.
///
/// `InputController` is a language-agnostic orchestrator — it manages composition buffers,
/// navigation, and key routing. All decisions that depend on the target language (which
/// characters extend a word, which punctuation triggers auto-space removal, when to
/// capitalise) are delegated to a `TypingRules` conformer.
///
/// Default implementations are provided for `insertsTrailingSpace` and the two
/// capitalisation methods (`preserveCapitalization`, `applyCapitalization`). Conformers
/// only need to supply the three character sets.
///
/// - Note: Members may appear in both `compositionContinuationMarks` and
///   `autoRemoveSpaceChars` (e.g. U+2019 in English). This is intentional:
///   `InputController` checks continuation marks before auto-space removal, so an
///   overlapping character never reaches the auto-space path mid-word.

    /// for contractions and elisions). Named generically so future languages can supply
